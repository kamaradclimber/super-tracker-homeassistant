# Super Tracker for Home Assistant

âš  This integration is a prototype to improve activity detection based on multiple signals.

## TODOs

- [ ] Expose a "commute" sensor to show whether it's likely to be in a commute situation
- [ ] Reliably detect "in a train"
- [ ] Reliably detect "waiting for a train"
